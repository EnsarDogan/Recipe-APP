# Recipe APP

I am planning to create a recipe app by using [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). This app provides me with some cool fetch options.
I will use https://coolors.co/ for the color palette for the UI.


**MUST HAVES**
1. Create the project structure
2. Create the schema for the recipes
3. Create a page to view the recipes 
4. Add the ability to fetch random meal by using TheMealDB and create a button to show on the frontend (name, image, some other informations)
5. Add the ability to search meal by name by using TheMealDB and create a search input section on the frontend
6. Add the ability to show the ingredients of the meal that user selects or clicks on the frontend
7. Prepare the repository


**NICE TO HAVES**
1. Add a Like button under the meals so that you can create a favorite meals section by using Local Storage.
2. Add the ability to filter meals by category by using TheMealDB and create a search input section on the frontend
3. Add the ability to filter meals by area by using TheMealDB and create a search input section on the frontend
4. Add the ability to filter meals by main ingredients (chicken, chocolate i.e.) by using TheMealDB and create a search input section on the frontend
